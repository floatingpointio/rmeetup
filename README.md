A Ruby wrapper for the Meetup REST API v2.

Code Sample
-----------

Sample code is worth a thousand words:

```ruby
  client = RMeetup::Client.new do |config|
    config.api_key = "API_KEY"
  end
  
  results = client.fetch(:events, { event_id: 'some_id' })
  results.each do |result|
    # Do something with the result
  end
  
  event = client.post(:event, {:group_id => 'some_group_id',
                               :group_urlname => 'some_group_urlname',
                               :name => 'My Event'})
  
  client.delete(:event, 'event_id')  # May throw exceptions or returns true
```
